\noindent Han,\\

The commitee expects corrections to the following problems in the proposal defense documentation.
\begin{itemize}
\item  Grammar. Make concise and accurate statements.
\item  Reference. Use the most original reference and review papers.
\item  Have more numerical examples on the 1-D Buckley-Leverett flow example. If possible, include
more complicated testcases.
\end{itemize}

The committee also expect Han to publish two journal papers during the summer. The first paper
should be on the sensitivity analysis of using twin model; the second paper should be on
the optimization method of using twin model. The second paper should include a proof of convergence.\\
