Lax-Wendroff does not apply:
consistency + stability = convergence.

Consistent: The true PDE residual P\phi
            The twin-model discretized T\phi
            P - T not converge to 0 as \Delta x, \Delta t goes to 0
            not guaranteed
So even if stable twin model, theoretically does not guarantee convergence
Convergence: solution mismatch goes to 0 as Delta t and Delta x goes to 0.

Even if stability twin model, does not guarantee solution mismatch goes to 0.

Method 1: 
Minimize T with adaptive basis construction.
The simulate twin model to find twin-model solution u.
If: simulation not converge.
    simulation converge but large solution mismatch.
    simulation converge but small solution mismatch.
Check M.

When to 
Method 2:
Minimize M with adaptive basis construction.
