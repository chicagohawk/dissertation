\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chapter 4}
In this thesis, I addressed the optimization constrained by gray-box simulations.
I enabled the adjoint gradient computation for gray-box simulations by leveraging the
space-time solution. In addition, I utilized the gradient information in a Bayesian
framework to faciliate a more efficient optimization. 
To conclude, this chapter summarizes the developments and highlights
the contributions of this work. I close with suggestions for continuing work
on this topic.


\section{Thesis Summary}
Optimization constrained by conservation law simulations are prevelant in many engineering
applications.
In many cases, the code of the simulator is proprietary, legacy, and
lacks the adjoint capability. 
Chapter \ref{chap 1} categorizes such simulators as gray-box.
The gray-box scenario limits the efficient application 
of gradient-based optimization methods.
I motivates the need for the
adjoint gradient, and explains the feasibility
of estimating the adjoint gradient in the gray-box scenario.
The key is to leverage the gray-box space-time solution, which contains information
of the gray-box simulator but is usually abandoned by conventional optimization methods.
To restrict the scope of my thesis, a class of problems is formulated where the
flux functions are partially unknown.\\

To address this issue, an adjoint-enabled twin model is proposed 
to match the space-time solution.
In Chapter \ref{chapter 2}, I develop a two-stage procedure to estimate the gradient.
In the first stage, a twin model is trained to minimize the solution mismatch.
In the second stage, the trained twin model
computes an adjoint gradient which approximates the true gray-box gradient.
For a simple conservation law with only one equation and one dimensional space,
I demonstrate theoretically that the twin model can indeed infer the gray-box 
conservation law on a domain that has large solution variation.
To implement the twin model numerically,
the unknown part of the flux function is parameterized by a set of basis.
I argue that the sigmoid bases are well suited for this problem since
their gradients are local. The procedure is demonstrated
on a Buckley-Leverett equation using an ad hoc set of sigmoids.
Although the estimated gradient is accurate, several limitations are observed
which lead to the developments of adaptive basis construction.
Several tools are introduced for the adaptive basis construction,
including a metric of the basis significance, the basis neighborhood, 
and the cross validation.
The adaptive basis construction 
fully exploits the information contained in the
gray-box solution, and avoids the problem of overfitting.
Based upon these developments, a twin model algorithm is presented.
To reduce the computational cost of the algorithm, a pre-train step is suggested
that minimizes the integrated truncation error instead of the solution mismatch.
The twin model algorithm is demonstrated on 
a variety of numerical examples, including a 1D convection equation with unknown 
flux function, a 2D steady-state Navier-Stokes flow with unknown state equation,
and a 3D petroleum reservoir flow with unknown mobility factors.
In all the three examples, the twin model algorithm provides accurate estimates
of the true gradient, which represents a major contribution towards enabling the
adjoint gradient computation for gray-box simulations.\\

Using the twin-model gradient, optimization can be done more efficiently.
Chapter \ref{chapter 3} incorporates the twin-model gradient into a Bayesian optimization framework,
in which the objective function, the true gradient,
the estimated gradient, and the gradient error are modeled by Gaussian processes.
The model provide analytical expressions for the 
posterior distributions and the acquisition function, while the 
hyper parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood.
I present a Bayesian optimization algorithm that utilizes the twin-model gradient.
In addition, I show that the algorithm is able to find the optimal regardless
of the gradient estimation accuracy, if the true hyper parameters are used.
The optimization algorithm is demonstrated on several problems similar to Chapter \ref{chapter 2},
including a Buckley-Leverett equation with source term controls,
a Navier-Stokes flow in a return bend with boundary geometry controls,
and a petroleum reservoir with polymer-water injection rate controls.
In all the three examples, the
twin-model optimization achieves
near-optimality with less iterations than the vanilla Bayesian optimization. 
Finally, the twin model gradient is tested on a
$1000$-dimensional control problem, by employing a simple gradient descent approach. 
The gradient efficiently enables the optimization of the high-dimensional problem,
which represents another major contribution of my thesis.\\

\section{Future Work}
There are several potential thrusts of further research: 
A useful extension is to investigate the
inferrability of twin models for various conservation laws. In particular,
Theorem \ref{theorem: 1} may be extended for problems with a
system of equations and higher spatial dimension. Another interesting extension
is to study the applicability of the pre-train step, especially to
obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for bounding $\mathcal{M}$
with $\mathcal{T}$. Finally, in the twin-model Bayesian optimization algorithm, 
it is of great practical value to reuse twin model more efficiently.
My current approach uses the twin model with the closest solution as an initial guess,
and re-trains the twin model at every iterate. In the future, an important
research topic is on how to utilize all previously trained twin models. Another important topic 
is to employ ``trust region'' in the optimization: the same twin model can be used multiple times
at different controls inside a trust region\footnote{In my thesis,
the twin model is re-trained at each new control. Generally, gradient-based
trust region methods require the gradient to satisfy a property called full-linearity.
Unfortunately, this property is not guaranteed 
by the twin-model gradient. The lack of full-linearity is a key factor
that refrains me from exploring the trust-region methods. See 
\cite{trustregionconn} and \cite{trustregionwild} for the details.}, thus reducing
the training cost.
Finally, it is interesting to generalize the formulation \eqref{eqn: govern PDE} to
incorporate unknown source terms and boundary conditions.\\
